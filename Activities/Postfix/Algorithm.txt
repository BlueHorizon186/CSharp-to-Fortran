Postfix Expression Evaluation Algorithm:

1) S = Empty Stack

2) Read all tokens one by one. Label each token as 't'.

3) If 't' is a number, then do S.Push(t).

4) If 't' is an operator, then do:
	x = S.Pop()
	y = S.Pop()
	S.Push(y operator x)

5) Repeat 2 to 4 until all tokens have been evaluated.

6) The Result should be the only element remaining in S.
