Number_Man
By Carl Sandburg

He was born to wonder about numbers.

He balanced five5 against 10s
and made them sleep together
and love each other.

He took 6s and 7s
and set them wrangling and fighting
over raw bones.

He woke up 2s and 4s
out of baby sleep
and touched them back to sleep.

He mananged 8s and 9s,
gave them prophet beards,
marched them into mists and mountains.

He added all the numbers he knew,
multiplied them by new_found numbers
and called it a prayer of Numbers.

For each of a 1_000_000 cipher silences
he dug up a mate number
for a candle light in the dark.

He knew love numbers, luck numbers,
how the sea and the stars
are made and held by numbers.

He died from the wonder of numbering.
He said good_by as if good_by is a number.
