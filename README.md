# CSharp-to-Fortran
This repository will include the Compilers Design course exercises and the final project, which consists in implementing a small Fortran 77 compiler written in C#.

By course requirements, the project has to be hosted on Bitbucket. The link is at the end of this file. I will also store it in my Github repository to have a backup and because I have all of my other projects here.
